# Neon Mini-Hackathon
Hello everyone, and welcome to our Neon Team's mini-hackathon. It's a pretty simple project for us to practice our coding skills and do some team bonding.

## Getting started
* Download .Net Core SDK 3 if you don't have it
* Clone this repository
* That's it, you're ready to go!

## What are the goals?
* Practice clean code
* Practice SOLID principles
* Have some fun! :)

## What are the rules?
* Two teams will compete against each other (If Vit√£o wants to code, he can, but good luck to whoever gets a PHPzeiro on the team)
* Use whatever libraries you want
* Use whatever persistence method you want
* Implement all the methods in the controllers (or as much of them as possible)
* Use all the fields already present in the entities
* You can remap the properties (for example, use UserId instead of User in the entities) if you find it better to work with
* That's pretty much it, go crazy and get it done

## What are the evaluation criteria?
* Clean code
* SOLID principles
* Test coverage
* Test quality
* Implementation of all the methods
